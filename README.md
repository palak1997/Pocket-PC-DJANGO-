# Pocket-PC-DJANGO
1. An Andoid APP, which can control PC files, example browsing data (uploading downloading files), uploading files on Social media sites.
2. Server made using Django,python for file and document search ,use of different python API's and python for web crawling.

Pause a movie streaming from the comfort of the sofa, Email a forgotten file from your home to your office, Upload a dp from phone
on Facebook which is in your computer, Well these are just some of the problems we face daily which creates a need to gain remote
access to your PC even from halfway across the world? Keeping these objectives in mind we came up with this idea of
creating an Android Application where in you can access your PC and its data from anywhere in the world if you have the application setup on your PC as well .We are also well aware about the software packages like TEAMVIEWER and REMOTE UTILITIES but developing softwares of such level needs a lot of experience and expertise. So ours would be a modest application which would have the below
mentioned features.
1. Sending and receiving e-mails with your attached files and documents
2. Controls of the music /video player
3. Updating your social media accounts
4. Many more would be added as we advance in the project One remarkable feature of our application that we would like to highlight is that browsing and uploading downloading of the documents and files can be done when your PC is in SLEEP MODE which is obvious in most of the cases.
